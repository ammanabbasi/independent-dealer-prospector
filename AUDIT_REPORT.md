## 🧪 Test & Coverage Analysis

```
Tests Run: 4/4 ✅ PASSED
Coverage: 9% 🔴 CRITICAL (No change - requires new test development)
Files with 0% coverage: app.py, components/maps.py, deploy.py
```

**Coverage by Module:**
- `models/database.py`: 94% ✅
- `services/communication_service.py`: 26% 🔴
- `services/crm_service.py`: 14% 🔴
- `tests/test_crm.py`: 52% 🟡
- **All other files**: 0% 🔴

**Recommendations:**
1. **Urgent**: Add unit tests for all service classes
2. **High**: Add integration tests for Streamlit components  
3. **Medium**: Add end-to-end tests for user workflows
4. **Low**: Mock external API calls (Google Maps, OpenAI, Twilio)

---

## 🔒 Security Analysis

**Bandit Security Scan Results:**
- **18 Low-severity issues** (acceptable for development tools)
- **0 High/Medium severity issues** ✅

**Key Security Findings:**
1. Subprocess usage in `deploy.py` and `setup_environment.py` - **Low risk** (development scripts)
2. Assert statements in tests - **No action needed** (standard practice)
3. Git commands use partial paths - **Low risk** (controlled environment)

**Security Recommendations:**
1. ✅ API keys properly handled via `secrets.toml`
2. ✅ No hardcoded credentials found
3. ✅ Proper environment variable usage
4. ✅ Input validation implemented for user-supplied data

---

## 📱 Android App Analysis

**AndroidManifest.xml Review:**
```xml
Permissions: ✅ Appropriately scoped
- INTERNET, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE: Required for WebView
- ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION: For location features
- No over-broad permissions detected
```

**MainActivity.java Review:**
- ✅ Clean WebView implementation
- ✅ Proper network connectivity checks
- ✅ Secure HTTPS URL hardcoded
- ✅ Good error handling

**Issues:**
- Gradle build environment issue (Android SDK path)
- Missing unit tests for Android components

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Structure Review

**✅ Strengths:**
- Clear separation of concerns (components/, models/, services/)
- Modular design with proper imports
- Comprehensive documentation
- Good naming conventions
- **NEW**: Robust widget key management system implemented

**⚠️ Areas for Improvement:**
- `app.py` is too large (1,907 lines) - should be split
